# ML1_Final_Project
This is a repository created for my final project of the course DTSA 5509 Introduction to Machine Learning - Supervised Learning. Please do not present my work as your own without proper citation, thank you!

In this project, I will view the prediction of sleep quality as a binary class classification task. I will use my friend's daily sleep data to train and test 5 different supervised machine learning models that are commonly used to tackle binary class classifications, namely logistic regression, decision tree, adaboost, random forest, and support vector machine models. Then the model with the best performance will be selected to predict sleep quality with unseen data under similar conditions.
